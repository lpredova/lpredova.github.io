            <p class="about-text">
                I'm web developer from Croatia and currently I'm a full time student at Faculty of organization and informatics in Varazdin.
                <span class="about-mark">My passion is creating stuff like websites, mobile apps or simple scripts.</span>
                Also, I love boring stuff like databases and messing around a server.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I often compete on hackathons and attend development meetings, conferences because I still haven't found what I like to work one day.
                I simply love programming and creating stuff from 0.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Although the thing I like the most is developing a good or funny or just ridiculous idea with my colleagues from faculty.
                I really enjoy working in groups where everybody does their work because it encourages me to give my best contribution to the team.
                Nothing makes me more confident than having knowledgeable people around me because it's great when you have someone who can really show you how things are done.
                <span class="about-mark">Being a part of a good team is AWESOME.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                My biggest virtue is that I never give up till the problem is solved and the biggest flaw is that sometimes I'm too passionate about my work so often overwork myself to death.
                Learning, new technologies are great! I love learning and I can learn new stuff very very fast!

            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Currently I'm working on several projects for free.
                Usually I'm a one man band, back-end/front-end web developer, DB administrator and system admin,
                in the extreme cases web designer.
                Usually my work is to configure the server (Apache), make things work (PHP, Laravel, NodeJS), think of
                how to handle the data (PostgreSQL, MySql, MongoDB) and even sometimes (again in extreme cases)
                I have to make front end web applications (AngularJS, query and all other beauties of front-end).
                Besides that, I know a bit about Android and Java, but that's totally opposite direction from web dev so I've decided to leave that to others.
                <span class="about-mark">You can't know it all. Right?</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I have Bacc. degree but my pinion is that a college degree is not (at all) as valuable as some practical
                coding and database skills.
                <span class="about-mark">I'm not too much of theoretician, I like to see how things work,break them and then make them work even better.</span>

            </p>

            <p class="about-text">

                So if <span class="about-mark">YOU</span> think I can help you and your team in any way free to contact
                me, I'm open for
                cooperation,
                internships and job offers anytime.
