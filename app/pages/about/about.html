            <p class="about-text">
                I'm 22, from Croatia and currently I'm full time student at FOI, Varazdin studying databases.
                <span class="about-mark">My passion is creating stuff like websites, mobile apps or simple scripts.</span>
                Also I love boring stuff like databases and messing around server.
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I often compete on hackatons and attend developer meetings,conferences because I still haven't found
                what I like to work one day.
                <span class="about-mark">I simply love programming and creating stuff from 0.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Althought the thing I like the most is developing a good or funny or just ridiculous idea with my
                colleges from faculty. I really enjoy working in groups where everybody does their work because it
                encourages me to give my best contribution to the team. Nothing makes me more confident then having
                knowledgeable people around me because it's great when you have someone who can really show you how
                things are done. <span class="about-mark">Working in good team is AWSOME.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                My biggest virtue is that I never give up till the problem is solved and biggest flaw is that sometimes
                I'm too passionate about my work so often overwork myself to death.

                <span class="about-mark">Learning, new technologies is great! I love learning and I can learn new stuff very very fast !</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                Currently I'm working on several projects for free. Usually I'm one man band, backend/frontend web
                developer,db
                administrator and system admin, in extreme cases web designer.
                Usually my work is to configure server (Apache) , make things work (PHP,Laravel,NodeJS),
                think of how to handle data(PostgreSQL,MySql,MongoDB) and even sometimes (again in extreme cases)
                I have to make frontend web applications (AngularJS,JQuery and all other beauties of frontend).
                Besides that I know a bit of Android and Java but that's totally opposite direction from web dev so I've
                decided to leave that to others.
                <span class="about-mark">You can't know it all. Right?</span>
            </p>

            <p class="about-text">
                I have bacc. degree but my pinion is that college degree is not (at all) as valuable as some practical
                coding and database skills.
                <span class="about-mark">I'm not too much of theoretician, I like to see how things work,break them and then make them work better.</span>

            </p>

            <p class="about-text">

                So if <span class="about-mark">YOU</span> think I can help you and your team in any way free to contact
                me, I'm open for
                cooperation,
                internships and job offers anytime.
